# Introduction

The `samples` folder provides the sample projects for Agora MediaPlayer Kit. You can download and view the source codes first.

When integrating the MediaPlayer Kit, you need the tool named as `RtcChannelPublishHelper` to publish the video and audio streams during playback to remote audience in Agora channel. Agora provides `RtcChannelPublishHelper` for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows platforms. 
> For the Android platforms, ensure that the version of `RtcChannelPublishHelper` is the same as the SDK version you are using. For example, if your SDK is v2.4.x, use the helper in the `2_4_0` folder.

For more details, see the [integration guide](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/mediaplayer_android?platform=Android
).
